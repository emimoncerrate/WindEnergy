# Con Edison Strategic Opportunities Matrix - Dashboard

## Overview
The dashboard has been completely redesigned to function as a strategic opportunities matrix specifically for Con Edison's investment needs. This tool filters through the noise and presents a prioritized list of actionable investment opportunities based on Con Edison's unique strategic imperatives.

## üéØ Main Visualization: The Opportunities Quadrant

### **Scatter Plot with Two Key Axes:**
- **Y-Axis: Strategic Fit Score (0-100)** - How well an opportunity aligns with Con Edison's Investment Thesis Tags
- **X-Axis: Technology Readiness Level (TRL 1-9)** - Maturity level of the technology

### **Quadrant Analysis:**
- **Top-Right (Sweet Spot):** High strategic value + proven, de-risked technology
- **Top-Left (Research):** High strategic value + early-stage technology
- **Bottom-Right (Emerging):** High strategic value + early-stage technology
- **Bottom-Left (Monitor):** Lower priority opportunities

## üîç Primary Filters: Investment Thesis Tags

The dashboard is fully filterable by Con Edison's Investment Thesis Tags:
- **Transmission Decongestion**
- **Grid Modernization**
- **Renewable Integration**
- **Energy Storage**
- **Demand Response**
- **Microgrid Development**
- **EV Infrastructure**
- **Smart Grid Technologies**
- **Grid Resilience**
- **Carbon Reduction**

An analyst can click on any thesis tag (e.g., "Transmission Decongestion") and instantly see all relevant companies, technologies, and projects.

## üéØ Strategic Fit Scoring (0-100)

- **95-100:** Grid Infrastructure & Transmission (Direct alignment with Con Ed's core business)
- **85-94:** Energy Storage & Smart Grid (High strategic value)
- **75-84:** Renewable Integration & Demand Response (Strong alignment)
- **65-74:** Microgrid & EV Infrastructure (Good alignment)
- **Below 65:** Other technologies (Lower priority)

## üî¨ Technology Readiness Level (TRL 1-9)

- **TRL 1-3:** Basic Research (Early stage, high risk)
- **TRL 4-6:** Development & Testing (Mid-stage, moderate risk)
- **TRL 7-9:** Commercial Ready (Proven technology, lower risk)

## üíé Sweet Spot Criteria

Opportunities in the "Sweet Spot" meet these criteria:
- **Strategic Fit Score ‚â• 70**
- **TRL Level ‚â• 7**

These represent the highest priority investments for Con Edison.
