# Con Edison Strategic Investment Intelligence Platform - Transformation Complete

## Overview
Successfully transformed the AI analyzer from venture capital funding analysis to utility strategic investment intelligence. The system now evaluates opportunities based on Con Edison's regulated business model and strategic investment criteria.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated AI Analyzer (`analyzer.py`)
- **Class Renamed**: `ClimateTechFundingAnalyzer` → `ConEdisonStrategicAnalyzer`
- **New Strategic Focus**: Evaluates opportunities for Con Edison's regulated utility business
- **Enhanced Prompts**: Retrained AI to think like a utility strategist

### 2. New Utility Strategic Investment Schema
The analyzer now extracts these key strategic investment data points:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `investment_thesis_tag` | Primary reason Con Edison should care | "Grid Reliability", "Peak Load Reduction", "Storm Hardening" |
| `technology_readiness_level` | TRL score 1-9 | 7 (commercial-ready) |
| `regulated_asset_potential` | Can become rate-based asset? | True/False |
| `ny_service_territory_relevance` | Impacts NYC/Westchester? | True/False |
| `grid_impact_score` | Grid improvement potential 1-10 | 8 |
| `clcpa_compliance_value` | CLCPA mandate benefits | "Reduces building emissions by 40%" |
| `capital_investment_required` | Investment level needed | Low/Medium/High |
| `implementation_timeline` | Deployment timeline | Short/Medium/Long term |
| `risk_assessment` | Investment risk level | Low/Medium/High |
| `strategic_priority` | Con Edison strategic priority | High/Medium/Low |

### 3. Updated Configuration (`config/sources.json`)
- **New Sources**: Added Con Edison News, NYISO Market Updates
- **Investment Thesis Tags**: 19 strategic categories including:
  - Grid Reliability
  - Peak Load Reduction
  - Transmission Decongestion
  - Electrification of Heat/Transport

#### **Technology Readiness Levels (TRL)**
- **TRL 1-3**: Concept development (research phase)
- **TRL 4-6**: Prototype testing (pilot phase)
- **TRL 7-9**: Commercial deployment (utility preference)

#### **Regulated Asset Potential**
- **Keywords**: "infrastructure", "grid asset", "capital investment"
- **Criteria**: Long-term assets that can be added to rate base
- **Examples**: Transmission lines, substations, smart meters

#### **NY Service Territory Relevance**
