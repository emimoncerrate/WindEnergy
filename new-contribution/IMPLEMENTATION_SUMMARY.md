- **Amount extraction**: Regex-based extraction of funding amounts ($30bn, $55M, etc.)
- **Stage classification**: Identification of funding stages (seed, Series A, B, C, etc.)
- **Category classification**: Automatic categorization as "funding" vs "offshore_wind"

### 3. **Dual-Mode AI Analysis**
- **Funding articles**: Enhanced prompts for company names, investors, funding rounds
- **Infrastructure articles**: Standard prompts for grid infrastructure and utility relevance
- **Market trend analysis**: AI-powered insights into funding trends and implications

### 4. **Comprehensive Data Structure**
- **New fields**: `category`, `has_funding_content`, `funding_amount`, `funding_stage`
- **Enhanced analysis**: `company_name`, `investors`, `funding_round_type`, `market_trend`
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing fields maintained

## ðŸ“Š Test Results

### Data Collection Performance
- **Total articles collected**: 64
- **Funding articles detected**: 23 (36% of total)
- **Offshore wind articles**: 9 (14% of total)
- **Funding category articles**: 55 (86% of total)

### Funding Intelligence Extracted
- **Investment amounts**: $30bn, $55M, $160M, $750M, $28M, etc.
- **Funding stages**: Various stages identified
- **Companies**: VentureUnity and others detected
- **Market trends**: AI analysis of funding implications

### System Reliability
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of rate limits and API failures
- **Fallback analysis**: Default analysis when AI calls fail

      "category": "funding",
      "funding_keywords": ["raised", "funding", "investment", "Series", "seed", "venture"]
    }
    // ... 8 additional funding sources
  },
  "analysis_categories": {
    "funding_keywords": ["raised", "funding", "investment", "Series A", "seed", "venture"],
    "funding_stages": ["seed", "Series A", "Series B", "Series C", "Series D", "growth", "IPO"]
  }
}
```

### Scraper Enhancements (`scraper.py`)
- **Funding detection methods**: `_detect_funding_content()`, `_extract_funding_amount()`, `_extract_funding_stage()`
- **Enhanced data extraction**: Automatic categorization and funding information extraction
- **Improved logging**: Summary statistics for funding vs infrastructure articles

### Analyzer Enhancements (`analyzer.py`)
- **Dual analysis modes**: Different prompts for funding vs infrastructure articles
- **Enhanced gap analysis**: Funding stage distribution, investment amounts, top companies/investors
- **Market trend analysis**: AI-powered insights into funding implications

## ðŸš€ Usage Instructions

### Running the Enhanced System
```bash
# 1. Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Collect data (funding + infrastructure)
python scraper.py

# 3. Analyze data with dual-mode AI analysis
python analyzer.py
```

### Output Files
